The professional life of a dancer is generally one of constantly changing work situations,
    strong competitive pressure and low pay. Consequently,
    professional dancers often must supplement their incomes to achieve financial stability. In the U.S. many professional dancers belong to unions (such as the American Guild of Musical Artists, Screen Actors Guild and Actors' Equity Association) that establish working conditions and minimum salaries for their members. Professional dancers must possess large amounts of athleticism. To lead a successful career, it is advantageous to be versatile in many styles of dance, have a strong technical background and to utilize other forms of physical training to remain fit and healthy.<br/>

    <h4>Dance teachers</h4>
    </font>
     <h4>
        </h4> Dance teachers typically focus on teaching dance performance, or coaching competitive dancers, or both. They typically have performance experience in the types of dance they teach or coach. For example, dancesport teachers and coaches are often tournament dancers or former dancesport performers. Dance teachers may be self-employed, or employed by dance schools or general education institutions with dance programs. Some work for university programs or other schools that are associated with professional classical dance (e.g., ballet) or modern dance companies. Others are employed by smaller, privately owned dance schools that offer dance training and performance coaching for various types of dance. <font color="#ff80b3"><h4>Choreographers</h4></font> Choreographers are the ones that design the dancing movements within a dance, they are often university trained and are typically employed for particular projects or, more rarely may work on contract as the resident choreographer for a specific dance company.<br/><br/> <a name="1.5"><font size="5"color="#00ffff"><center><ins>1.5</ins></font></center></a> <font color="#ff704d"><h3>Importance of dance</h3></font> Dance is a health-promoting physical activity which many people worldwide incorporate into their lifestyles today.

Dance teaches the importance of movement and fitness in a variety of ways through a variety of disciplines. As well, dancers learn to coordinate muscles to move through proper positions. Dancing is a great activity to pursue at almost any age provided you are in proper health to handle the rigors of dancing for life.</p> All in all, dance is a great way to build invaluable social skills. Much more importantly however, it is an opportunity to teach your children the importance of being part of something larger than themselves. Dancers learn to take turns, to share attention, and to cooperate with others as they work within a group. These life lessons are part of the appeal of dance classes to parents around the world. Much like team sports, dance for children can teach some invaluable and important lessons. <a name="1.8"><font size="5"color="#00ffff"><center><ins>1.8</ins></font></center></a> <center> <font color="#ff704d"><h3>Types of dances</h3></font> <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/7gsh5plcnpz4sxr/Screenshot_20201027-055147.png?dl=0"width=300></center> <ol> <li><font color="#ff80b3"><h4>African, West Indian, and African-American</h4></font></li> <ul type="disc"> <li>Bolojo</li> <li>PPDD</li> <li>Boge</li> <li>Stepping</li> <li>Stick dance</li> <li>Kizomba</li> <li>Kompa</li> <li>Jazz dance</li> </ul> <li><font color="#ff80b3"><h4>Ceremonial dance</h4></font></li> <ul type="disc"> <li>Haka</li> <li>Kagura</li> <li>Ritual dances of China</li> <li>Cham dance</li> <li>Drametse Ngacham</li> <li>Kumha Pyakhan dance</li> <li>Prophetic dance</li> <li>Rejang dance</li> <li>Sanghyang</li> <li>Sufi whirling</li> <li>Worship dance</li> </ul> <li><font color="#ff80b3"><h4>Disco/Electronic dance</h4></font></li> <ul type="disc"> <li>Boogaloo</li> <li>Bump</li> <li>Cutting shapes</li> <li>Waacking</li> <li>Free step</li> <li>Hustle</li> <li>Jumpstyle</li> <li>Penguin</li> <li>Robot</li> <li>Watergate</li> </ul> <li><font color="#ff80b3"><h4>Historical dance</h4></font></li> <ul type="disc"> <li>Ballet/France</li> <li>Baroque dance</li> <li>Medieval dance</li> <li>Polka dance</li> <li>Regency dance</li> <li>Renaissance dance</li> </ul> <li><font color="#ff80b3"><h4>Street dance</h4></font></li> <font color="#8080ff"><h5>Hip-hop dance</h5></font> <ul type="disc"> <li>Breakdancing</li> <li>Cabbage Patch</li> <li>Cat Daddy</li> <li>Dougie</li> <li>Electric boogaloo</li> <li>Gangsta Walking</li> <li>Harlem shake</li> <li>Jerkin'</li>

            Most forms of dance may be considered aerobic exercise and as such can also reduce the risk of
            cardiovascular disease, help weight control, stress reduction, and bring about other benefits commonly
            associated with physical fitness. In addition, studies have demonstrated a considerable correlation between
            dancing and psychological well-being. A large amount of governmental, health, and educational information is
            available extolling the benefits of dance for health.

            <h3>Why dance is important?</h3>
        </font>
        Creative thinking skills are developed through dance, as well as learning the value of discipline, commitment
        and work ethic. Self-confidence develops as young people overcome challenges to master new goals, learning to
        apply themselves and accomplish any task put before them.<br />

            hspace=10px>
        <p align="right">
            <i>Dance teaches children about music, rhythm and beat.</i> Students also have a better understanding of
            spatial relationships and learn to think with both sides of their brain. All these skills enhance a child’s
            academic performance, as well as their physical well-being.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
            Dance keeps you fit! Dance teaches the importance of movement and fitness in a variety of ways through a
            variety of disciplines. As well, dancers learn to coordinate muscles to move through proper positions.
            Dancing is a great activity to pursue at almost any age provided you are in proper health to handle the
            rigors of dancing for life.</p>
        All in all, dance is a great way to build invaluable social skills. Much more importantly however, it is an
        opportunity to teach your children the importance of being part of something larger than themselves. Dancers
        learn to take turns, to share attention, and to cooperate with others as they work within a group. These life
        lessons are part of the appeal of dance classes to parents around the world. Much like team sports, dance for
        children can teach some invaluable and important lessons.
